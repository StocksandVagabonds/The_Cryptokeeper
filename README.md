# The Cryptokeeper: Elon Muskâ€™s Influence on the Crypto Market
### Kelly Yang, Chris Meggs, and Anh Dao

With the rise of cryptocurrencies built upon the implementation of blockchain technology,
we have ultimately transformed the modern understanding of currency, ledgers, and
financial systems. In particular, the need for a decentralized global currency that is not
tied to any governing entity has presented itself as an attractive way for people to conduct
transactions, store value, and even generate wealth. Fueled by the global Covid-19
pandemic and the subsequent inflationary pressures due to stimulus spending,
cryptocurrencies have seen increased mainstream and institutional adoption driving
continual, volatile, and rapid market expansion. This meteoric rise corresponds closely
with increased social media discussion and positive sentiment regarding the burgeoning
technology. This study will be conducted by examining past market history and trying to
understand the relationship between social patterns and price movements. We will build
upon existing research around the use of machine learning and Bayesian regression on
Twitter sentiment to improve price prediction models. It will do so by focusing on the
impact that a particular influential voice (Elon Musk) may have in the crypto market.
